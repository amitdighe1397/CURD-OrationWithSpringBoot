In Java, the main method serves as the entry point for a Java application. The Java Virtual Machine (JVM) looks for the public static void main(String[] args) method to start the execution of a Java program. While it's technically possible to overload the main method by defining multiple methods with the same name in the same class, the JVM will only recognize and execute the standard public static void main(String[] args) signature.

Here's an example demonstrating how you can overload the main method:

java
Copy code
public class MainMethodOverload {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This is the standard main method.");
    }

    // Overloaded main method
    public static void main(String arg1, String arg2) {
        System.out.println("This is an overloaded main method with two String arguments.");
    }

    // Another overloaded main method
    public static void main(int num) {
        System.out.println("This is an overloaded main method with an integer argument.");
    }
}
Despite having multiple main methods in the class, when you run the program, the JVM will still call the standard public static void main(String[] args) method. Other overloaded main methods won't be automatically invoked by the JVM.

To call the overloaded main methods, you need to do so from within the standard main method or from other methods within the class. For example:

java
Copy code
public class MainMethodOverload {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("This is the standard main method.");
        
        // Calling the overloaded methods
        main("arg1", "arg2");
        main(5);
    }

    // Overloaded main method
    public static void main(String arg1, String arg2) {
        System.out.println("This is an overloaded main method with two String arguments.");
    }

    // Another overloaded main method
    public static void main(int num) {
        System.out.println("This is an overloaded main method with an integer argument.");
    }
}
In practice, it's generally recommended to stick with the standard public static void main(String[] args) signature to ensure that the program can be executed by the JVM as intended. Overloading the main method with different parameter types won't be recognized by the JVM for the purpose of starting the program.
